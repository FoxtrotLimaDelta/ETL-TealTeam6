      "Self-medicating with science in the midst of squalorThis is not an easy read. The narrator and lead character, Layla, warns us of this early on:  \"Life is hard and complicated and messy. Life is parasites that live in your gut and brilliant scientists teaching a gorilla to use sign language. Life is moths that drink tears, and the flu virus, and nothing you can control. Life is sometimes using a knife to comb your hair, because absolutely nothing else works, and life always finds a way through.\"Living with a mother that's in turn abusive and neglectful, and the brother who is her world, Layla experiences things no child or adult should. It's awful, but it's her life so she knows how to survive, trying to learn all she can, focusing on the minutiae and detail of science to ignore the big picture in front of her. Due to how she's been self-raised and lives, she's an easy target for bullies. You know, just in case her life isn't difficult enough. Pretty much this whole book needs a trigger warning. It's graphic and raw and real, an episode of Hoarders in quiet honesty, no made for TV drama needed. Yet that brutal rawness makes it compelling in that train wreck sort of way, hoping for better for innocent kids born into filth and neglect. Perhaps it's drama, or teaching compassion for others, or just something to gawk at with gratitude for my own fortune. The ending seems to pile on even more, the light at the end of the tunnel burned out. Just finishing the last page, and I'm left with swirling emotions, caring too much for people living in my Kindle. \n",

      "An emotionally gripping story of a young girl just trying to survive.The synopsis for this book immediately grabbed my attention. I knew this wouldn't be an easy read. However, I set my hopes high, because if I was going to put myself through this gut-retching experience, I expected the quality of the work to be stellar. As you can see from my review, the author delivered. The author did a phenomenal job capturing the voice of a young girl, Layla Bailey, who is so broken down, yet at the same time, so strong and brave. From the introduction, when Layla is literally using a knife to detangle the knots in her hair, I connected to her. Not in a relatable way, obviously, but I felt every emotion she felt. It's not even dark outside yet, but I am done with the day. I lie there trying to hold it together until the day is done with me. Layla has two things she cares about, science and her brother, Andy.Despite her wretched living conditions, and no true parental guidance, it is amazing what a smart, thoughtful girl she grew up to be. And that's why it broke my heart to see how each day was a struggle.Would they have light?Would they have food?Would she have to syphon water out of her bathroom to prevent flooding? Yes, that really happened.And on top of that, she had to deal with all the school bullies.But she doesn't let all of that drag her down and destroy her dreams. She never gave up hope and made me love her all the more for it.What could they possibly do to me? I'm already nothing.This is a compelling read about the strength of one young girl's character, and how her actions ultimately save her. While the subject matter isn't easy to read, I encourage everyone to read it. It's real. It's honest. It's powerful.For more reviews, visit\n",

While we have the narration of Layla about what is happening, we don't really know how she feels about it. We kind of get glimpses but from the first flashback of trying to care for her own hair to the ending, we don't really know her emotional state.-While the book is horrifying, some things don't make sense: They live in an upstairs apartment, they have water leaks that evidently don't go into the bottom floor. There is a level of neglect that no adult would ever let slide no matter what a 14 year old says. There is this weird bullying thing that goes on that ends up being resolved in a very unsatisfactory way. There is more but that would provide spoilers - it is a very uneven book and can't quite decide what it wants to be. So while I read it quickly because I wanted to find out what happens to Layla and her brother, in the end, it was somewhat unsatisfying. Hence, the downgrade in my rating.\n",

There are many things that are admirable about \"Find Layla.\" There are many things that are stunning about \"Find Layla.\" Yet, what I am most drawn to with this somewhat short yet substantial story is just how much empathy Elison offers to Layla and how much she manages to ensure the young girl's dignity even in those difficult to read moments that are traumatic, humiliating, and far too often the stuff of very real childhoods. Fourteen-year-old Layla is a SoCal teen living a life that is hidden but actually isn't. She's incredibly self-aware, yet underprivileged and the subject of nearly constant bullying at the junior high school where it seems like everyone else is privileged. The only real attention she gets is from the school's \"mean girls\" who tweet about her ragged appearance, greasy hair, dirty clothes and, well, smell. Somehow, amidst it all, she carries a deep love for science and a 4.0 GPA.When a school competition calls for a biome, an increasingly vulnerable Layla decides to peel off the layers of masks she's been wearing over every aspect of her life. Boy, does she get attention.When Child Protective Services inevitably responds, Layla loses the only world she's known. I mean, sure that world sucked. But, she knew it. Visible for the first time in her life, Layla has to learn how to face her truths and maintain her wholeness in a world that is suddenly watching her every move. \"Find Layla\" could have gone wrong. It probably should have gone wrong. \"Find Layla\" never goes wrong, because Elison infuses the story with honest characters, a realistic story, just the right amounts of hope, empathy without pity, and a resolute determination that Layla deserves the dignity that life hasn't given her. This is an immersive, difficult to put down book and yet an emotionally resonant book that will move some to tears and perhaps be a tad too difficult for some others. An Amazon First Reads offering during the month of August, \"Find Layla\" is due for release by Skyscape on September 1st and it's a definitely winning novel for the award-winning Elison. At its literary core, \"Find Layla\" paints a realistic world for Layla that is undeniably tragic in that truth. Yet, Elison is also writing about growing from the lives we're given and breaking free from the cycles that continue to bind us. Refusing to offer Layla anything resembling an articial, paint-by-numbers resolution, Elison instead offers her something even greater - empowerment and a sliver of light with which to grow. The dialogue in \"Find Layla\" feels honest and truthful, Layla's occasional advanced language an obvious result of her strong academics and fiercely disciplined studying even against amazing obstacles. There could have been so many cliche's that came out of \"Find Layla,\" but Elison for the most part avoids them in favor of multi-shaded social workers, foster parents, well-meaning do-gooders, and those godawful bullies who sometimes truly never change. Refreshingly, even the supporting characters are drawn with complexity. Layla's brother Andy is so clearly developed that you can easily visualize him, while her mother waxes such a tragic figure that you practically expect her to spew forth Shakespeare. Layla's friend Kristi feels just like the kind of friend that Layla would have, while other characters like Bette, Dr. Jones, Erica, and others come alive in really special ways. To offer too much in the way of narrative would spoil the emotional rollercoaster that is \"Find Layla,\" a book that I can't quite call entertaining yet a book that is so substantial that it feels as if it shifted around my reader's DNA. As my first title from Elison, \"Find Layla\" is a book that will inevitably lead me to explore more of her previous works. Filled with insightful exploration about poverty, neglect, and the worlds in which many of our children are raised in, \"Find Layla\" finds strength and resilience in vulnerability and courage and creates one of the year's most memorable YA characters whom you'll find yourself wanting to hug and you'll find yourself wanting to check in with every once in a while. Primarily known as a science fiction author, Elison has masterfully woven science into life's human tapestry and created an honest and true masterwork of survival of the teenage spirit. \n",

      "The secret lives of teenagers.Layla is an unusual 14-year-old. Her grade-point average is a perfect 4.0 and the teachers in the accelerated program she attends marvel at her intelligence and hard work. Clearly, she's a product of a stable, loving home with parents dedicated to giving their daughter every opportunity to reach her full potential. Right?Wrong. Layla lives in an apartment which long ago became a bio-hazard. Ever wonder why a huge percentage of children from low-income families suffer from chronic, debilitating asthma? Check out the place that Layla calls home and you'll figure it out. The front door doesn't open, but Layla's mother wouldn't let anyone in if it did. She has secrets to hide and Layla damned well better help her hide them.At fourteen, Layla is already a functioning adult, intent on surviving and caring for her younger brother Andy. She's learned to cover up and explain away and make herself invisible when things get bad. Like the insects that she can identify with Latin names, she lives by hiding in the cracks of modern life and sneaking out under cover of darkness.Layla's teachers wonder why her clothes are dirty and her personal hygiene is non-existent, but some kids DO wear the same clothes every day although they have others. And some refuse to bath or wash their hair, although they have working bathrooms. When questioned, Layla claims everything is fine. What can they do? It isn't until her one friend's kind-hearted mother insists on investigating that the crap hits the fan.So why does Layla lie instead of asking for help from adults who obviously care about her? She knows the limitations of Child Protective Services and she knows that \"intervention\" will separate her from her brother. She holds things together as long as she can. Four more years until she turns eighteen. Surely they can survive four more years.And what about her mother? She disappears for days and even when she's home, seems unaware of her children's existence. She acknowledges them only to rage about how much trouble they are and how much she's sacrificed for them. Mentally ill without question, but rational enough to hold down a job as an apartment manager and to fend off questions from teachers, school nurses, and social workers. But why keep her unwanted, unloved children with her?In King Solomon's time, the REAL mother wanted her child alive and well, even if it meant giving him up. Today, social workers and foster parents deal daily with the dreaded words \"I want my kid back.\" Parental rights are firmly embedded in American law and they can be invoked by severely abusive or neglectful parents. From mental institutions or prisons. The magic words to get what you want aren't \"Please and thank you\", but \"I want my kid back.\" Layla's mother knows the score and so does Layla. Don't rock the boat if you know what's good for you.Teens today, even ones who stay mostly under the radar, live out their lives on social media. They use it to flirt, to form alliances, to bully each other, to fool parents and teachers. And sometimes they post something that \"goes viral\" and captures the attention of millions. Layla's secrets become international news. Everyone knows all there is to know about her, except one thing. Where IS she?The ending is tricky and every reader will have their own opinion. Realistic or too pat? Best for the kids or not? I'm sure there are lazy social workers and abusive foster parents, but I think most do the best they can with a system that's underfunded and hampered by strict regulations. There are warm, fuzzy stories about kids raised by wonderful foster parents or adopted out of the foster-care program. Many go on to lead happy, productive lives. But it's a safety net with more holes than net and children who've been abused or neglected have deep emotional scars. Is counseling enough? Sometimes.I almost passed on this book, fearing that it would be too depressing. It's hard reading in places, but Layla is tough and resourceful and it's impossible not to fall in love with her. She's a scruffy flower miraculously growing up through a crack in a dirty sidewalk. Will she survive and thrive or (as so many \"rescued\" children do) fall back into the life she was taken from? All we have in life is hope.I think this is one of the most out-standing YA's I've ever read. I hope it's available in schools and public libraries. It's a harsh story, but one that needs to be told and this talented author tells it beautifully.\n",

      "This is a short, tense, but heartbreaking read that delves into the reality of neglected children. Their world, as bare and filthy as it may be, is what they know. For fourteen-year-old Layla Bailey it becomes her ecosystem, literally.Wet newspapers on the floor, black mold blooming along the walls, mushrooms growing in the dresser, maggots living in the broken fridge, this is how Laura Bailey and her little brother live. Their mother sometimes makes an appearance at this cockroach-infested apartment, but the kids never know what mood she’ll be in. Layla has taken it upon herself to make sure she and Andy get to school. At least there they get free lunch if they can survive the relentless bullying. It’s hard to wash your clothes when there is no money, and the smell from the damp, moldy apartment lingers on your clothes anyway. So the other kids have a heyday with the jokes and jabs at these hungry, dirty kids.Layla dreams of being a scientist, even with the hardship she faces at home, she is managing a 4.0 in her classes. When her science teacher announces a video competition depicting a biome, Layla knows she has the perfect biome in her apartment. She records it in all its toxic glory but also to her dark shame. But then the video goes viral. Before she can control the situation CPS has taken her family away, and bullies are knocking her down once again. Does she run and hide or face up to the reality she showed the world?Meg Ellison doesn’t let you come up for air with this one. You need to know what will happen to Layla and poor little Andy. It’s hard to imagine that children live this way, just surviving really, but they do. I think the take away from the story is to be alert, ask questions, and be available to help those in need. And help put an end to bullying, dang it!Thank you to #amazonfirstreads for this copy. This book will be available on September 1, 2020.\n",

But she concentrates on getting good grades and tries to tune them all out. Her one friends mother knows something is wrong and tries to help by buying Layla clothes and letting her shower at her house. But Layla stubbornly refuses to confide in her.When Layla gets loaned a camera to film a science project about biomes, she decides to film the mushrooms growing on her floor, the mold on the walls and the rotting food in the refrigerator. Her biome-the place she lives in. She wasn't going to use it, but then things come crashing down when her little brother is removed by social services,and she posts it on line and then goes on the run.The video goes viral and everyone is looking for Layla. Most want to help, but some of her old school mates just want to bully her some more by claiming she made everything up. After they taunt her into meeting them in a parking lot, where she really lets out her anger, the police \"catch\" her and she's put in the foster system. There's a bittersweet but realistic ending. The writing is excellent, and there's no sex or foul language. Adults can enjoy the read and it's a good read for teens, covering bullying and the hidden obstacles some children have to overcome. \n",

Layla doesn't share the video --until her brother is taken away by CPS and she has to find somewhere to live so she's not next. This was a great eye-opening book. About lives which are so different than ours. About a girl who has everything against her and still manages to make things work -- taking care of her little brother and managing to maintain her 4.0 average. This is about her resourcefulness -- finding places to eat and sleep. Finding ways to make an unbelievably difficult situation work. It's so hard to think people live this way, but I'm sure somewhere they do. It also gives perspective for bullying; you never know what someone else is going through.Layla was grateful for a coffee, a cup of tea or a shower. Makes you kind of think about how we don't realize everything we have.\n",

Elison captures the angst of a teenage girl, along with the insanity of living in a house that will never be a home.Throughout the story, you capture the essence of Layla - a brilliant scientist with razor sharp instincts just trying to make it through.You see her story through a lens of survival instincts born of necessity.There are painful parts, but there are moments of beauty in the chaos.It is an easy read, but it is an important one.After all, there are teenagers like Layla all around us - brilliant students slipping just under the radar just trying to get by.This novel is incredible.\n",

Layla is an exceptionally bright girl and has learned to work the system to hide her circumstances, but cannot hide her ratty hair, nor her worn out and dirty clothes. She is that girl in class who is targeted relentlessly by the mean girl crowd. Luckily she does have one very good friend from a good family, but Layla cleverly never lets her see where or how she really lives. Then comes the classroom science project, an opportunity to make a video about a biome. Layla doesn't really intend to use her home for the assignment, but circumstances align so that not only does she use the video, but also posts it on line. Her world suddenly starts unraveling. (As if it wasn't already in tatters anyway.) Using street smarts and adaptability, she attempts to hold onto what she believes to be true about life.Realistic. Often heartbreaking. 100% recommended.\n",

This fictional account is not easy to read because it is all too believable that there are many children in America who live in similar circumstances.Layla tried to keep them under the radar but faces ridicule and bullying from classmates for her appearance. She's a strong girl with intelligence, an unswerving love for her brother and a dream of becoming a scientist. So many obstacles to overcome but she persists, even when their secret is uncovered. For me, this was a sad but worthwhile story to read. It's not too long and the writing style is easy to read so it's accessible to readers from tween up. Bullying, homelessness, hunger and neglect are not issues any child should face but in Finding Layla author Meg Elison puts the spotlight on a child's perspective on a frightening hidden world.\n",

She will win you over with her cleverness, her love for her brother, and how her heart and her intelligence puts her above her bullies. My jaw dropped at the description of her “home”- I can’t imagine anyone living in those conditions. She uses her home as part of a science project which reveals her secret. Although this story didn’t have the happiest of endings, it was realistic and satisfying which I can appreciate. This is a story that needs to be told! “I stopped wondering a long time ago why some people have lives like Kristi’s while I have this one. I don’t think there are any rules on that. It’s just what we get.”“I hate her so much that if some idiot fell asleep on me while smoking, the hatred would leak out of me until it poured over the threshold and flooded the streets.”“I eat it all. The food, the light, the chair, the table. I eat Kristi’s safety and her mom’s love. I eat her stepdads job and her sister’s fancy college tuition. I’m stuffed with it when I put my clothes in the dryer. I eat like I’m never going to eat again.”\n",

Layla's determination to make something of herself as a scientist and help her little brother to succeed - or at least survive while her world was crumbled and broken was inspiring. She worked hard to seem \"normal\" and keep her head up even when what little she had was ripped from her arms. I loved how passionate Layla was about science, even taking steps to find it and implement it in her own life. I don't know what to say except it was enjoyable and made me cry in the end.-R\n",

      "A quick, but very readable YA novel.Find Layla is a book about 14-year old Layla, who is well aware that her family life and living situation is not normal, but maybe not the extent to which that is true until the video she makes about the living biome (read: biohazard) of her home goes viral. Frightened of being sent into care without her little brother, Layla goes on the run. The book is told from Layla's perspective, and it's a quick & compelling read, with a message at its heart about the damage we do by bullying people who are different, without trying to understand why that might be so. It does end quite abruptly, but if the premise of the book is to 'find' Layla, then once she is found, that is the end. So I guess it makes sense, but I would have liked to have seen more.However, it's one of the Kindle Books of the Month for August, so you can download if for free if you're interested. \n",
